# About
### ✨ This repository provides a simple and convenient way to convert Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) files to PDF format 🤓

### ✨ By following the instructions properly which are mentioned below, you can easily convert any Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file to PDF file 🚀

# Steps

### 👉🏻 Step 1 :
### To get started, at first you'll need to have `Python` installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### 👉🏻 Step 2 :
### Now Install `Anaconda Navigator` from the official website: https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/ 

### 👉🏻 Step 3 :
### Now you need to install `nbconvert` tool. To install nbconvert, follow the below mentioned steps:

- 1. Open the `command prompt` or terminal

- 2. Run the following command to install nbconvert using pip:
```
pip install nbconvert
```
- This command will download and install the nbconvert package and its dependencies. Wait for the installation to complete. You should see the progress in the command prompt or terminal.

### 👉🏻 Step 4 :
### Now you need to install `Pandoc` in addition to nbconvert if you want to convert .ipynb files to PDF format. Pandoc is a separate tool that nbconvert relies on for the conversion process.

- To install Pandoc, follow the below mentioned steps:


- Visit the Official Pandoc website at: https://pandoc.org/installing.html and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install `Pandoc`

- After the installation is complete, you can verify the installation by running the following command in the command prompt or terminal:
```
pandoc --version
```

- If the installation was successful, you should see the version information for Pandoc.

### 🔰 NOTE : RESTART your Device 💻 (Laptop or Desktop) after installing `nbconvert` and `pandoc`

### 👉🏻 Step 5 :
### Now the final tool that you will need is the `TeX` tool. 

- For converting notebooks to PDF (with --to pdf), nbconvert makes use of `LaTeX` and the `XeTeX` as the rendering engine.

- To install a complete TeX environment (including XeLaTeX and the necessary supporting packages) by hand can be tricky. Fortunately, there are packages that make this much easier.

- Because nbconvert depends on packages and fonts included in standard `TeX distributions`, if you do not have a complete installation, you may not be able to use nbconvert’s standard tooling to convert notebooks to PDF. These packages are specific to different `operating systems`. 

### Follow the below links as per your Operating System (OS) to `install` TeX:

- 1. [Windows](https://tug.org/texlive/windows.html)
- 2. [MacOS](https://tug.org/mactex/)
- 3. [Linux](https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html)

### Alternatively, you can also visit the Official website of TeX Live here: https://tug.org/texlive/

### 🔰 NOTE : TeXlive is a large distribution, and installing it might consume a significant amount of disk space. It has over 4000+ files. It might take 1-2 hours (depending upon the system) for TeX Live to install in your device. 

### 🔰 So be patient and leave the rest on installer.

### 🔰 Once you have `nbconvert`, `Pandoc` and `TeX` installed, you should be able to convert Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files to PDF

### 👉🏻 Now you can easily convert your `Jupyter Notebook` file to `PDF` file without any error using the `Anaconda Navigator` which you have installed in [Step No. 2](#steps)

# Using Anaconda Navigator
### After successfully completing all the above mentioned steps, now you are ready to go.
### Follow the below instructions carefully to convert your `Jupyter Notebook` file to `PDF` file using the `Anaconda Navigator` :

### Step 1 : Open Anaconda Navigator. Then Launch the `Jupyter Notebook`

- A new window will open up now and your conversion will be done in few seconds/minutes (depending upon the system).

### ☕ So be patient, have a Coffee, and leave the rest. You can also [![BUY ME A COFFEE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20Me%20a%20Coffee%20☕-%23FFDD00.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=buy-me-a-coffee&logoColor=black)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/creativepuru) here 😊
